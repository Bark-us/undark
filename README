Undark is a small program that searches through an iPhone iOS6
sms database for all messages, both current and deleted.

Undark is being presented here to the public under a BSD style 
licence (see the LICENCE file included in with this package).

Any comments/suggestions/correspondence can be directed to Paul Daniels

To use Undark, you'll need a copy of the sms.db off the iPhone.
You can get the sms.db using the very useful idevicebackup2 routine
provided by the libimobiledevice suite.
